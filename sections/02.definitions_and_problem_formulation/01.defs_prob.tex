\begin{definition}
  \label{def:definition_1} \textit{Range scan captured from a 2D LIDAR
  sensor}.---A conventional 2D LIDAR sensor provides a finite number of
  ranges, i.e. distances to objects within its range, on a horizontal
  cross-section of its environment, at regular angular and temporal intervals,
  over a defined angular range \cite{Cooper2018b}. A range scan $\mathcal{S}$,
  consisting of $N_s$ rays over an angular range $\lambda$, is an ordered map
  $\mathcal{S} : \Theta \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$,
  $\Theta = \{\theta_n \in [-\frac{\lambda}{2}, +\frac{\lambda}{2}) : \theta_n = -\frac{\lambda}{2}
  + \lambda \frac{n}{N_s}$, $n = 0,1,\dots, N_s$$-$$1$$\}$. Angles $\theta_n$
  are expressed relative to the sensor's heading, in the sensor's frame of
  reference.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:definition_2} \textit{Map-scan}.---A map-scan is a virtual scan
  that encapsulates the same pieces of information as a scan derived from a
  physical sensor. Only their underlying operating principle is different due
  to the fact the map-scan refers to distances to the boundaries of a
  point-set, referred to as the map, rather than within a real environment. A
  map-scan $\mathcal{S}_V^{\bm{M}}(\hat{\bm{p}})$ is derived by means of
  locating intersections of rays emanating from the estimate of the sensor's
  pose estimate $\hat{\bm{p}}$ and the boundaries of the map $\bm{M}$.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:definition_3} \textit{CAER as metric}.---Let
  $\mathcal{S}_p$ and $\mathcal{S}_q$ be two range scans, equal in angular
  range $\lambda$ and size $N_s$. The value of the Cumulative Absolute Error
  per Ray (CAER) metric $\psi \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ between $\mathcal{S}_p$
  and $\mathcal{S}_q$ is given by
  \begin{align}
    \psi(\mathcal{S}_p,\mathcal{S}_q) \triangleq \sum\limits_{n=0}^{N_s-1} \Big| \mathcal{S}_p[n]-\mathcal{S}_q[n]\Big| \nonumber
  \end{align}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:definition_4} \textit{CAER as field}.---A $\psi$-field on map
  $\bm{M}$
  $f_{\psi}^{\bm{M}} : \mathbb{R}^2 \times [-\pi, +\pi) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$
  is a mappping of 3D pose configurations
  $\hat{\bm{p}}(\hat{x},\hat{y},\hat{\theta})$ to CAER values (def.
  \ref{def:definition_3}) such that if
  $\psi(\mathcal{S}_R,\mathcal{S}_V^{\bm{M}}(\hat{\bm{p}})) = c$ then
  $f_{\psi}^{\bm{M}}(\hat{\bm{p}}) = c$. In other words a CAER field is
  produced by computing the value of the CAER metric between a range scan
  $\mathcal{S}_R$ (def. \ref{def:definition_1}) and a map-scan
  $\mathcal{S}_V^{\bm{M}}(\hat{\bm{p}})$ captured from pose configuration
  $\hat{\bm{p}}$ within map $\bm{M}$ (def. \ref{def:definition_2}).

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:definition_6} \textit{Rank field}.---Let $f_{\psi}^{\bm{M}}$ be
  a $\psi$-field on map $\bm{M}$ and $\mathcal{P} = \{\hat{\bm{p}}_i\}$,
  $i \in \texttt{I} = \langle 0,1,\dots,|\mathcal{P}|-1 \rangle$, where the
  notation $\langle\cdot\rangle$ denotes an ordered set, be a set of 3D pose
  configurations within map $\bm{M}$, such that
  $f_{\psi}^{\bm{M}}(\mathcal{P}) = \mathcal{C}$. Let $\mathcal{C}_\uparrow$
  denote set $\mathcal{C}$ ordered in ascending order and $\mathcal{I}_{\uparrow}$
  be the set of indices such that $\mathcal{C}[\mathcal{I}_{\uparrow}] = \mathcal{C}_\uparrow$
  (where the bracket notation $\mathcal{C}[\texttt{I}] = \mathcal{C}$).
  A $\texttt{r}$-field on map $\bm{M}$
  $f_{\texttt{r}}^{\bm{M}} : \mathbb{R}^2 \times [-\pi, +\pi) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$
  is a mapping of 3D pose configurations $\mathcal{P}$ to non-negative integers
  such that if $f_{\psi}^{\bm{M}}(\mathcal{P}[\texttt{I}]) = \mathcal{C}$ then
  $f_{\texttt{r}}^{\bm{M}}(\mathcal{P}[\mathcal{I}_\uparrow]) = \texttt{I}$, or,
  equivalently,
  $f_{\texttt{r}}^{\bm{M}}(\mathcal{P}) = \mathcal{I}_\uparrow$.
  In other words a rank field maps the elements of pose estimate set $\{\hat{\bm{p}}_i\}$
  to their corresponding ranks $\mathcal{I}_\uparrow$ in the hierarchy of
  ascending CAER values $\mathcal{C}_\uparrow = \texttt{sort}(\mathcal{C}, \text{asc})$.

  Let the unknown pose of an immobile 2D range sensor whose angular range is
  $\lambda$ be $\bm{p}(x,y,\theta)$ with respect to the reference frame of map
  $\bm{M}$. Let the range sensor measure range scan $\mathcal{S}_R$. The
  objective is the estimation of $\bm{p}$ given $\bm{M}$, $\lambda$, and
  $\mathcal{S}_R$.
