\begin{definition}
  \label{def:definition_1}
  \textit{Definition of a range scan captured from a conventional 2D LIDAR
  sensor}. A conventional 2D LIDAR sensor provides a finite number of ranges,
  i.e. distances to objects within its range, on a horizontal cross-section of
  its environment, at regular angular and temporal intervals, over a defined
  angular range \cite{Cooper2018b}. A range scan $\mathcal{S}$, consisting
  of $N_s$ rays over an angular range $\lambda$, is an ordered map
  $\mathcal{S} : \Theta \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, $\Theta =
  \{\theta_n \in [-\frac{\lambda}{2}, +\frac{\lambda}{2}) : \theta_n =
  -\frac{\lambda}{2} + \lambda \frac{n}{N_s}$, $n = 0,1,\dots, N_s$$-$$1$$\}$.
  Angles $\theta_n$ are expressed relative to the sensor's heading, in the
  sensor's frame of reference. The angular distance between two consecutive
  rays is the sensor's angle increment $\gamma \triangleq \lambda/N_s$.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:definition_2}
  \textit{Definition of a map-scan}.
  A map-scan is a virtual scan that encapsulates the same pieces of information
  as a scan derived from a physical sensor. Only their underlying operating
  principle is different due to the fact the map-scan refers to distances to
  the boundaries of a point-set, referred to as the map, rather than within a
  real environment. A map-scan $\mathcal{S}_V^{\bm{M}}(\hat{\bm{p}})$ is
  derived by means of locating intersections of rays emanating from the
  estimate of the sensor's pose estimate $\hat{\bm{p}}$ and the boundaries of
  the map $\bm{M}$.

  \textit{The Cumulative Absolute Error per Ray (CAER) metric}.
  Let $\mathcal{S}_p$ and $\mathcal{S}_q$ be two range scans, equal in angular
  range $\lambda$ and size $N_s$. The value of the Cumulative Absolute Error
  per Ray metric $\psi \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ between $\mathcal{S}_p$ and
  $\mathcal{S}_q$ is given by
  \begin{align}
    \psi(\mathcal{S}_p,\mathcal{S}_q) \triangleq \sum\limits_{n=0}^{N_s-1} \Big| \mathcal{S}_p[n]-\mathcal{S}_q[n]\Big| \nonumber
  \end{align}
\end{definition}

\begin{customprb}{P}
  \label{prob:the_problem}
  Let the unknown pose of an immobile 2D range sensor whose angular range is
  $\lambda$ be $\bm{p}(x,y,\theta)$ with respect to the reference frame of map
  $\bm{M}$. Let the range sensor measure range scan $\mathcal{S}_R$. The
  objective is the estimation of $\bm{p}$ given $\bm{M}$, $\lambda$, and
  $\mathcal{S}_R$.

\begin{customhpt}{H}
  \label{hpt:hypothesis_h1}
  Let the unknown pose of an 2D range sensor measuring range scan
  $\mathcal{S}_R$ be $\bm{p}(x,y,\theta)$ with respect to the reference frame
  of map $\bm{M}$.  Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a set of pose hypotheses within the
  free (i.e. traversable) space of $\bm{M}$:
  $\mathcal{H} = \{\hat{\bm{p}}_i\} \subseteq \texttt{free}(\bm{M})$, $i=0,1,\dots,|\mathcal{H}|-1$; $\mathbb{S}$
  be the set of map-scans (def. \ref{def:definition_2}) of $\bm{M}$ from pose
  hypotheses $\mathcal{H}$:
  $\mathbb{S} = \{\mathcal{S}_V^{\bm{M}}(\hat{\bm{p}}_i)\}$; and $\Psi$ be the
  set of CAERs (def. \ref{def:definition_3}) between $\mathcal{S}_R$ and the
  elements of $\mathbb{S}$:
  $\Psi = \{\psi(\mathcal{S}_R, \mathcal{S}_V^{\bm{M}}(\hat{\bm{p}}_i))\}$.
  Then there exist $\delta_0,\psi_0 \in \mathbb{R}_{> 0}$ which define a set of
  pose estimates $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{H}$ such that
  \begin{align}
    \|\bm{p}-\hat{\bm{p}}_\mathcal{V}\|_2 &< \delta_0 \nonumber \text{ and}\\
    \psi(\mathcal{S}_R,\mathcal{S}_V^{\bm{M}}(\hat{\bm{p}}_\mathcal{V})) &< \psi_0 \nonumber
  \end{align}
  for all $\hat{\bm{p}}_\mathcal{V} \in \mathcal{V}$, for which
  \begin{align}
    \psi(\bm{p}, \hat{\bm{p}}_\mathcal{V}) &< \psi(\bm{p}, \hat{\bm{p}}_{\mathcal{H} \backslash \mathcal{V}}) \nonumber \\
    &\Rightarrow \nonumber \\
    \|\bm{p}-\hat{\bm{p}}_\mathcal{V}\|_2 &< \|\bm{p}-\hat{\bm{p}}_{\mathcal{H} \backslash \mathcal{V}}\|_2 \nonumber
  \end{align}
  for any $\hat{\bm{p}}_{\mathcal{H} \backslash \mathcal{V}} \in {\mathcal{H} \backslash \mathcal{V}}: \|\bm{p}-\hat{\bm{p}}_{\mathcal{H} \backslash \mathcal{V}}\|_2 \geq \delta_0$.
