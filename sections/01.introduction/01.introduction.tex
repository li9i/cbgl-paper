This paper addresses the problem of Passive Global Localisation of a 2D LIDAR
sensor, i.e. the estimation of its location and orientation within a given map,
under complete locational and orientational uncertainty, without prescribing
motion commands (to the mobile robot that the sensor is assumed mounted to) for
further knowledge acquisition. The problem is formalised in Problem
\ref{prob:the_problem}:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{customprb}{P}
  \label{prob:the_problem}
  Let the unknown pose of an immobile 2D range sensor whose angular range is
  $\lambda$ be $\bm{p}(\bm{l},\theta)$, $\bm{l} = (x,y)$, with respect to the
  reference frame of map $\bm{M}$. Let the range sensor measure range scan
  $\mathcal{S}_R$. The objective is the estimation of $\bm{p}$ given $\bm{M}$,
  $\lambda$, and $\mathcal{S}_R$.
\end{customprb}

           up to $2.0$ m. In this example $10^6$ hypotheses are dispersed
           randomly in the free space of a map with area $735$ m$^2$, for $100$
           independent trials; CBGL's maximum location error and maximum
           execution time are, respectively, $0.062$ m and $8.8$ sec }

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section
\ref{section:definitions} provides necessary definitions and the notation
employed. Section \ref{section:sota} gives a brief review of the
literature of solutions to problem \ref{prob:the_problem}, and the relation of
the proposed method to them.  The latter's methodology is presented in section
\ref{section:the_proposed_method}, its evaluation in section
\ref{section:results}, and its limitations in section
\ref{section:characterisation}. Section \ref{section:finale} concludes this
study.
