In tasks involving navigation of a mobile robot the knowledge of its initial
pose is a prerequisite, especially in contexts where an observer is used for
pose tracking. However, not in all tasks is the robot's pose predictable or
settable in advance, and this results in the need for its ad hoc estimation
without priors. Various sensor and map modalities have been investigated in the
literature; from 2D and 3D LIDAR sensors \cite{als_eth,Cop2018a}, RGBD
cameras \cite{Guo2016}, and RFID equipment \cite{Tzitzis2023b}, to
keyframe-based submaps \cite{Lowry2016} and metric maps \cite{Rosen2021}. The
latter combined with 2D LIDAR sensors have become the de facto means in mobile
robot localisation and navigation due to the sensor's high measurement
precision, high update frequency, almost no need for preprocessing, and low
cost compared to 3D LIDAR sensors.

This article addresses the problem of Passive Global Localisation of a 2D LIDAR
sensor in a metric map, i.e. the estimation of its location and orientation
within the map, under complete locational and orientational uncertainty,
without prescribing motion commands (to the mobile robot that the sensor is
assumed mounted to) for further knowledge acquisition. The problem is
formalised in Problem \ref{prob:the_problem}:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{customprb}{P}
  \label{prob:the_problem}
  Let the unknown pose of an immobile 2D range sensor whose angular range is
  $\lambda$ be $\bm{p}(\bm{l},\theta)$, $\bm{l} = (x,y)$, with respect to the
  reference frame of map $\bm{M}$. Let the range sensor measure range scan
  $\mathcal{S}_R$. The objective is the estimation of $\bm{p}$ given $\bm{M}$,
  $\lambda$, and $\mathcal{S}_R$.
\end{customprb}

           Given a LIDAR sensor's 2D measurement, at its core, CBGL disperses
           pose hypotheses within the map and ranks them ascendingly according
           to the value of the Cumulative Absolute Error per Ray (CAER) metric.
           %The latter's inputs comprise the input measurement and the map-scan
           %captured from each hypothesis.
           This produces a
           \texttt{r}(ank)-field which may be used to estimate the pose of the
           sensor (a) quickly due to the metric's low computational complexity,
           and (b) accurately due to (i) proportionality between the pose
           estimate error and the value of the metric for pose estimates in a
           neighbourhood of the sensor's pose, and (ii) lack of
           disproportionality outside of that neighbourhood.  Top: a map of an
           environment, the pose of a panoramic 2D LIDAR sensor (magenta), and

           up to $2.0$ m
           %In this example $10^6$ hypotheses are dispersed
           %randomly in the free space of the map whose area is $735$ m$^2$, for
           %$100$ independent trials; CBGL's maximum location error and maximum
           %execution time are, respectively, $0.062$ m and $8.8$ sec

For the solution of Problem \ref{prob:the_problem} this article introduces
CBGL: a single-shot Monte Carlo method
(a) which makes no assumptions regarding the structure or the particulars of the
sensor's environment or the sensor's characteristics,
(b) whose pose errors exhibit robustness to varying sensor angular range, and
(c) which operates with three optionally-set and intuitive parameters, which
trade accuracy for execution time.
The central contributions of the article are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item To the best of the author's knowledge the fastest Monte Carlo global
        localisation method that employs a 2D LIDAR
  \item The extension and validation of the CAER metric's ability to infer
        pose error hierarchies solely from real and virtual range scans,
        extended from scan--to--map-scan matching (\texttt{sm2}) during
        pose-tracking (where pose errors are ``small") to the context of
        global localisation, where hypotheses' errors may be arbitrarily large
  \item The thorough evaluation of the proposed method against (a) established
        state-of-the-art localisation methods, (b) real and publicly available
        benchmark conditions, and (c) varying characteristics of environments
        and sensors, which target real conditions that pose hindrances to global
        localisation methods
\end{itemize}


The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section
\ref{section:definitions} provides necessary definitions and the notation
employed. Section \ref{section:sota} gives a brief review of the
literature of solutions to problem \ref{prob:the_problem}, and the relation of
the proposed method to them.  The latter's methodology is presented in section
\ref{section:the_proposed_method}, its evaluation in section
\ref{section:results}, and its limitations in section
\ref{section:characterisation}. Section \ref{section:finale} concludes this
study.
