This paper addresses the problem of Passive Global Localisation of a 2D LIDAR
sensor, i.e. the estimation of its location and orientation within a given map,
under complete locational and orientational uncertainty, without prescribing
motion commands (to the mobile robot that the sensor is assumed mounted to) for
further knowledge acquisition. The problem is formalised in Problem
\ref{prob:the_problem}:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{customprb}{P}
  \label{prob:the_problem}
  Let the unknown pose of an immobile 2D range sensor whose angular range is
  $\lambda$ be $\bm{p}(\bm{l},\theta)$, $\bm{l} = (x,y)$, with respect to the
  reference frame of map $\bm{M}$. Let the range sensor measure range scan
  $\mathcal{S}_R$. The objective is the estimation of $\bm{p}$ given $\bm{M}$,
  $\lambda$, and $\mathcal{S}_R$.

           Given a LIDAR sensor's 2D measurement, at its core, CBGL disperses
           pose hypotheses within the map and ranks them ascendingly according
           to the value of the CAER metric (Eq. (\ref{eq:caer})). The latter's
           inputs comprise the input measurement and the map-scan captured from
           each hypothesis. This produces a \texttt{r}(ank)-field which may be
           used to estimate the pose of the sensor (a) accurately due to the
           proportionality of estimate error and CAER, and (b) quickly due to
           the metric's low computational complexity.  Top: a map of an
           environment, the pose of a panoramic 2D LIDAR sensor (magenta), and
           the corresponding CAER rank field below them. Bottom: distribution
           of CAER values by location $\Delta \hat{\bm{l}}$ and orientation
           error $\Delta \hat{\theta}$ of all sensor pose hypotheses
           corresponding to the rank field above, for estimate position errors
           up to $2.0$ m. In this example $10^6$ hypotheses are dispersed
           randomly in the free space of a map with area $735$ m$^2$, for $100$
           independent trials; CBGL's maximum location error and maximum
           execution time is, respectively, $0.062$ m and $8.8$ sec }

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section
\ref{section:definitions} provides necessary definitions and the notation
employed. Section \ref{section:sota} gives a brief review of the
literature of solutions to problem \ref{prob:the_problem}, and the relation of
CBGL to them.  The methodology of CBGL is presented in section
\ref{section:the_proposed_method}, its evaluation in section
\ref{section:results}, and its limitations in section
\ref{section:characterisation}. Section \ref{section:finale} concludes this
study.
