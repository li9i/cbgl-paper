\begin{customprb}{P}
  \label{prob:the_problem}
  Let the unknown pose of an immobile 2D range sensor whose angular range is
  $\lambda$ be $\bm{p}(x,y,\theta)$ with respect to the reference frame of map
  $\bm{M}$. Let the range sensor measure range scan $\mathcal{S}_R$. The
  objective is the estimation of $\bm{p}$ given $\bm{M}$, $\lambda$, and
  $\mathcal{S}_R$.

           CBGL leverages the relationships of (a) proportionality between the
           pose estimate error and the value of the CAER metric for pose
           estimates in a neighbourhood of the origin, and (b) lack of
           disproportionality outside of that neighbourhood: pose hypotheses
           dispersed within the map and ranked ascendingly according to the
           value of that metric produce a \texttt{r}(ank)-field, which may be
           used to estimate the pose of a 2D LIDAR sensor accurately, and
           quickly due to the low complexity of the CAER metric.
           Top: a map of an environment, the pose of a panoramic 2D LIDAR
           sensor (magenta), and the corresponding CAER rank field below them.
           Bottom: distribution of CAER values by location and orientation
           error of all sensor pose hypotheses corresponding to the
           rank field above, for estimate distances up to $2.0$ m
