This paper addresses the problem of Passive Global Localisation of a 2D LIDAR
sensor, i.e. the estimation of its location and orientation within a given map,
under complete locational and orientational uncertainty, without prescribing
motion commands (to the mobile robot that the sensor is assumed mounted to) for
further knowledge acquisition. Specifically the problem is formalised in
Problem \ref{prob:the_problem}:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{customprb}{P}
  \label{prob:the_problem}
  Let the unknown pose of an immobile 2D range sensor whose angular range is
  $\lambda$ be $\bm{p}(\bm{l},\theta)$, $\bm{l} = (x,y)$, with respect to the
  reference frame of map $\bm{M}$. Let the range sensor measure range scan
  $\mathcal{S}_R$. The objective is the estimation of $\bm{p}$ given $\bm{M}$,
  $\lambda$, and $\mathcal{S}_R$.

           Given a 2D LIDAR sensor's measurement, at its core, CBGL disperses
           pose hypotheses within the map and ranks them ascendingly according
           to the value of the CAER metric, producing a \texttt{r}(ank)-field
           which may be used to estimate the pose of the sensor quickly due to
           the low complexity of the CAER metric.
           Top: a map of an environment, the pose of a panoramic 2D LIDAR sensor
           (magenta), and the corresponding CAER rank field below them.
           Bottom: distribution of CAER values by location and orientation
           error of all sensor pose hypotheses corresponding to the rank field
           above, for estimate distances up to $2.0$ m.
           In this example the map's area is $800$ m$^2$, and $10^6$ hypotheses
           were dispersed randomly in its free space for $100$ times; CBGL's
           maximum location error and maximum execution time were,
           respectively, $0.062$ m and $8.8$ sec
