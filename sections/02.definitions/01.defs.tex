\begin{definition}
  \label{def:definition_0} \textit{Pose and pose estimate}.---The object of
  localisation is the estimation of the---fundamentally-unknown---3DoF pose
  $\bm{p}$ of a sensor or robot: $\hat{\bm{p}} = (\hat{\bm{l}}, \hat{\theta})$,
  where $\hat{\bm{l}} = (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ is its location on the 2D plane
  and $\hat{\theta} \in [-\pi, \pi)$ rad its orientation relative to the
  positive $x$ axis.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:definition_1} \textit{Range scan captured from a 2D LIDAR
  sensor}.---A range scan $\mathcal{S}$, measured by a 2D LIDAR sensor,
  consisting of $N_s$ rays over an angular range $\lambda \in (0,2\pi]$, is an
  ordered map of angles to distances between objects and the sensor within its
  radial range $r_{\max}$: $\mathcal{S} : \Theta \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq
  0}$, $\Theta = \{\theta_n \in [-\frac{\lambda}{2}, +\frac{\lambda}{2}) :
  \theta_n = -\frac{\lambda}{2} + \lambda \frac{n}{N_s}$, $n = 0,1,\dots,
  N_s$$-$$1$$\}$.  Angles $\theta_n$ are expressed relative to the sensor's
  heading, in the sensor's frame of reference \cite{Cooper2018c}.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:definition_2} \textit{Map-scan}.---A map-scan is a virtual scan
  that encapsulates the same pieces of information as a scan derived from a
  physical sensor (Def. \ref{def:definition_1}). Contrary to the latter it
  refers to distances within a map $\bm{M}$ of an environment rather than within
  the environment itself; the latter is represented by $\bm{M}$ usually in
  Occupancy Grid or ordered Point Cloud form. A map-scan
  $\mathcal{S}_V^{\bm{M}}(\hat{\bm{p}})$ is derived by locating intersections
  of rays emanating from a sensor's pose estimate $\hat{\bm{p}}$ and the
  boundaries of $\bm{M}$.

  \label{def:definition_3} \textit{The Cumulative Absolute Error per Ray metric}.---Let
  $\mathcal{S}_p$ and $\mathcal{S}_q$ be two range scans (Def.
  \ref{def:definition_1}), equal in angular range $\lambda$ and size $N_s$. The
  value of the Cumulative Absolute Error per Ray (CAER) metric $\psi \in
  \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ between $\mathcal{S}_p$ and $\mathcal{S}_q$ is given by
  \begin{align}
    \psi(\mathcal{S}_p,\mathcal{S}_q) \triangleq \sum\limits_{n=0}^{N_s-1} \Big| \mathcal{S}_p[n]-\mathcal{S}_q[n]\Big| \label{eq:caer}

  %$\bm{M}$
  %$f_{\psi}^{\bm{M}} : \mathbb{R}^2 \times [-\pi, +\pi) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$
  %is a mapping of 3D pose configurations

  %$f_{\psi}^{\bm{M}}(\hat{\bm{p}}) = c$.
  %%In other words a CAER field is
  %%produced by computing the value of the CAER metric between a range scan
  %%$\mathcal{S}_R$ (Def. \ref{def:definition_1}) and a map-scan
  %%$\mathcal{S}_V^{\bm{M}}(\hat{\bm{p}})$ captured from pose configuration

  %A $\texttt{r}$-field on map $\bm{M}$
  %$f_{\texttt{r}}^{\bm{M}} : \mathbb{R}^2 \times [-\pi, +\pi) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$
  %is a mapping of 3D pose configurations $\mathcal{P}$ to non-negative integers
  %such that if $f_{\psi}^{\bm{M}}(\mathcal{P}) = f_{\psi}^{\bm{M}}(\mathcal{P}[\texttt{I}]) = \Psi$ then
  %$f_{\texttt{r}}^{\bm{M}}(\mathcal{P}[\texttt{I}^\ast]) = \texttt{I}$.
  %%(equivalently:
