Navigation of a mobile robot is conditioned on the knowledge of its pose. In
observer-based localisation configurations its initial pose may not be knowable
in advance, leading to the need of its estimation. The Monte Carlo class of
solutions---robust against noise---disperse hypotheses in the environment's map
and gradually converge on an estimate, thus requiring motion and time, which
may be economised on. Feature-based solutions require minimal estimation time
but assume environmental structure, may be sensitive to noise, and require
preprocessing and tuning. The method proposed in this article retains the
positive qualities of the two main approaches to global localisation and avoids
their negative ones: it requires a single measurement from a 2D LIDAR sensor,
assumes no motion, environmental structure, or parameter tuning in a
per-environment basis, and is robust against noise.  A large number of tests,
in real and simulated conditions, involving disparate environments and sensor
properties, illustrate the proposed method's increased pose discovery rate and
reduced execution time over state-of-the-art methods of both classes.
