Given a LIDAR sensor's 2D measurement, at its core, CBGL disperses pose
hypotheses within the map and ranks them ascendingly according to the value of
the Cumulative Absolute Error per Ray (CAER) metric. The latter's inputs
comprise the input measurement and the map-scan captured from each hypothesis.
This produces a \texttt{r}(ank)-field which may be used to estimate the pose of
the sensor (a) quickly due to the metric's low computational complexity, and
(b) accurately due to (i) proportionality between the pose estimate error and
the value of the metric for pose estimates in a neighbourhood of the sensor's
pose, and (ii) lack of disproportionality outside of that neighbourhood.  The
source code is available for download.
