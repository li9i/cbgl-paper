Range scans with panoramic angular ranges induce fewer pose ambiguities in
rank-fields than those with non-panoramic field of view. In the latter case
this means that, given the evidence of subsections \ref{subsec:exp_a} and
\ref{subsec:exp_c} where $\lambda = 3\pi/2$ rad, the choice of $k=10$ largely
inhibits the propagation of ambiguities to the output (fig.
\ref{fig:c:errors_and_time}).  However, non-panoramic sensors coupled
with repeated environment structures may give rise to the conditions of figure
\ref{fig:h_and_h_not_fig} (bottom). Other sources of potential, large pose
errors for CBGL are portrayed in figure \ref{fig:a:map_and_trajectory}: (a)
regions coloured with cyan indicate closed glass doors, wherein high range
errors result in discrepancy with map-derived virtual ranges, which is
subsequently propagated to $\psi$-fields and hence $\texttt{r}$-fields, and (b)
regions coloured purple indicate vicinities around doors, wherein
higher locational density or values of $k$ may be required to suppress pose
ambiguities propagated to $\texttt{r}$-fields.
