  \caption{\small Left: CBGL's execution time with respect to environment area
           for two choices of overlying scan--to--map-scan matching
           (\texttt{sm2}) methods. In rough terms
           $time \text{ [sec]} = 17\cdot10^{-3}\cdot area \text{ [} \text{m}^2 \text{]}$.
           Right: Proportion of total execution time
           spent on (a) all operations up to and except for matching, and (b)
           computing map-scans, with respect to area}

  \caption{\small Contrary to fig. \ref{fig:h_fig1}: the $\psi$-field (left)
           and \texttt{r}-field (right) of a configuration where Observation
           \ref{obs:observation_o} cannot be made: set $\mathcal{V}$ is
           empty of admissible pose estimates for $\delta < 4.5 \ (\text{m}^2 + \text{rad}^2)^{1/2}$.
           The effect is in fact produced due to the repetition of the
           immediate environment of the sensor more than once in the given map
           and its apparent dissimilarity to its corresponding portion of the
           map}
