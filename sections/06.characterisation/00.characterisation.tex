Rank-fields produced by panoramic angular ranges induce fewer pose ambiguities
than those produced by non-panoramic ones. In the latter case this means that
(a) given the evidence of subsections \ref{subsec:exp_a} and
\ref{subsec:exp_c}, where $\lambda = 3\pi/2$ rad, the choice of $k=10$ largely
inhibits the propagation of ambiguities to the output (fig.
\ref{fig:c:errors_and_time}), and (b) increasing values for $k$ beyond that
value may result in increased errors. However,  non-panoramic angular ranges
coupled with repeated environment structures may give rise to the conditions of
figure \ref{fig:h_not_fig1}, which are observed in environment WILLOGARAGE,
during the simulations of subsection \ref{subsec:exp_b} when $\lambda =
3\pi/2$. Other sources of potential, large pose errors for CBGL are portrayed
in figure \ref{fig:a:map_and_trajectory}: (a) regions encoded with cyan
indicate closed glass doors, wherein great discrepancy with respect to
map-derived virtual ranges may be observed, which is subsequently propagated to
$\psi$-fields and hence $\texttt{r}$-fields, and (b) regions encoded with
purple indicate vicinities around doors, wherein the amount of environment and
map information is restricted.
