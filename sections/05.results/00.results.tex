This section serves the testing of Hypothesis \ref{hpt:hypothesis_h} under
state of the global localisation art methods and CBGL, in varying environmental
conditions and sensor configurations. With regard to CBGL its three required
parameters are set to $(d_{\bm{l}},d_{\alpha},k) = (40, 2^5, 10)$ after
initial tests with the dataset used in subsection \ref{subsec:exp_a}.
The rationale of choosing appropriate $d_{\bm{l}},d_{\alpha}$ is depicted in
figure \ref{fig:a:determine_40_32}, and $k$ is chosen as such in order to
retain a high-enough true positive discovery rate without significant increase
in execution time.
%(due to the application of scan--to--map-scan matching on $k$
%pose estimates).
References to sets $\mathcal{H}_{\ast}$ are made to fig. \ref{fig:block_system}
(left) and lines \ref{alg:cbgl:h}, \ref{alg:cbgl:h1}, and \ref{alg:cbgl:h2} of
Algorithm \ref{alg:cbgl}. All tests were performed with a processor of 12
threads and a clock speed of 4.00 GHz.

\subsection{Experiments in real conditions}
\label{subsec:exp_a}

The first type of test is conducted with the use of a Hokuyo UTM-30LX
sensor, whose angular range is $\lambda = 3\pi/2$ rad and radial range
$r_{\max} = 30.0$ m, in the  Electrical and Computer Engineering Department's
Laboratory of Computer Systems Architecture (CSAL), Aristotle University of
Thessaloniki, Greece, a map of which is depicted in figure
\ref{fig:a:map_and_trajectory}. The sensor was mounted on a Robotnik RB1 robot,
which was teleoperated within the environment while scans were being recorded.
This resulted in $N_{S}=6669$ range scans, whose number of rays are downsampled
by a factor of four before being inputted to CBGL and ALS \cite{als_jp}, an
algorithm which implements Free-Space Features \cite{als_eth}. Other global
localisation methods are not to tested for this type of experiment due to
their infeasible execution time with respect to the range dataset's volume (see
fig. \ref{fig:b:execution_times}). CBGL's internal \texttt{sm2}
method is chosen to be PLICP \cite{Censi2008c} due to its low execution time
and the sensor's non-panoramic field of view. The top of figure
\ref{fig:a:awesomeness} depicts the proportion of output pose estimates from
each method whose position and orientation error is lower than outlier
thresholds $\delta_{\bm{l}}$, $\delta_{\theta}$; at the bottom they are
depicted exclusively with regard to CBGL's output and its internal pose sets.
The mean and standard deviation of the two methods' execution times are
$(\mu_t^{\text{ALS}}, \sigma_t^{\text{ALS}}) = (6.15, 5.32)$ sec, and
$(\mu_t^{\text{CBGL}}, \sigma_t^{\text{CBGL}}) = (1.61, 0.06)$ sec. From the
experimental evidence it is clear that (a) hypothesis \ref{hpt:hypothesis_h} is
observed to be true $991$ times out of a thousand for an outliers' locational
threshold $\delta_{\bm{l}} = 0.5$ m when an angular threshold is
$\delta_{\theta}$ is not considered, and (b) CBGL outperforms ALS in terms of
(i) number of pose estimates within all locational and angular thresholds and
(ii) execution time.

\subsection{Simulations against sources of uncertainty}
\label{subsec:exp_b}

The second type of test concerns the main limiting factor of global
localisation methods, i.e. uncertainty---:arising e.g. from spurious
measurements, repeatability of surroundings, missing range information, or
their combinations. For this reason the experimental procedure of
\cite{Filotheou2022g} is extended here for the two methods tested therein,
i.e. PGL-FMIC and PGL-PLICP, and then for CBGL, ALS, MCL \cite{mcl}, and GMCL
\cite{gmcl}.  Specifically these methods are tested against the two most
challenging environments, i.e. WAREHOUSE and WILLOWGARAGE, in which a panoramic
range sensor is placed at $16$ different poses for $N = 100$ independent
attempts at global localisation per tested method. The tests are conducted with
the use of a sensor whose number of rays $N_s = 360$, maximum range
$r_{\max} = 10.0$ m, and noise $\mathcal{N}(0, 0.05^2)$ [m,m$^2$]. CBGL's
internal \texttt{sm2} method is chosen to be \texttt{x1}
\cite{Filotheou2023a} due to the periodicity of the range signal,
\texttt{x1}'s improved results over \texttt{sm2} matching state of the
art methods, and its ability in matching scans captured from greater initial
locational distances than ICP alternatives. The latter translates to the need
for smaller initial hypothesis sets: for each environment the locational
density is set to $3$\texttt{e}+04 divided by the free space area
of each environment. For Monte Carlo approaches MCL and GMCL the number of
initial hypotheses is also set to $3$\texttt{e}+04.

The maximum range of the sensor is such that the geometry of environment
WAREHOUSE causes (disorderly) extended lack of sampling of the sensor's
surrounding environment, which limits available information and may therefore
produce spurious measurements and increase ambiguities between candidate
estimates. In WILLOWGARAGE on the other hand, almost all sensor placements
result in complete sampling of its surroundings, but the sensor is purposefully
posed in such conditions as to challenge the localisation methods' ability to
perform fine distinctions between similar surroundings. Figure
\ref{fig:b:inliers_per_pose} depicts the percentage of outputs whose position
error is lower than $\delta_{\bm{l}} = 0.5$ m per tested pose, and figure
\ref{fig:b:execution_times} depicts the overall distribution of execution times
per tested environment and algorithm. CBGL's mean execution time in environment
WAREHOUSE is $\mu_t^W = 7.98$ sec and in WILLOWGARAGE $\mu_t^{G} = 3.59$ sec.
Although the cardinality of set $\mathcal{H}$ is equal for both environments
CBGL's execution times are uneven due to \texttt{x1}'s increased execution
time when dealing with scans with missing range information. Notwithstanding
the aforementioned sources of uncertainty, CBGL manages to exhibit the highest
number of inliers in each environment tested.

           inlier poses}

           WILLOWGARAGE and four times lower in WAREHOUSE}

\subsection{Simulations against environmental and \texttt{sm2} algorithmic disparity }
\label{subsec:exp_c}

The third type of test aims to inquire how the performance of CBGL scales with
respect to increasing environment area (and therefore to increased number of
hypotheses), environment diversity, sensor angular range, and choice of
overlying \texttt{sm2} method. CBGL is tested once in each of
$N_E \simeq 4.5$\texttt{e}+$04$ environments, generated via the experimental
procedure of \cite{Filotheou2023a}, which utilises five established and
publicly available benchmark datasets provided courtesy of the Department of
Computer Science, University of Freiburg \cite{datasets_link}.  The coordinates
of every map corresponding to each environment are corrupted by noise
$\mathcal{N}(0,0.05^2)$ [m, m$^2$]. The angular range of the range sensor
varies according to the overlying scan--to--map-scan matching method used: for
NDT \cite{ndt}, FastGICP \cite{fgi}, and FastVGICP \cite{fvg}: $\lambda =
3\pi/2$ rad; for \texttt{x1}: $\lambda = 2\pi$ rad. Measurement noise is
$\mathcal{N}(0,0.03^2)$ [m,m$^2$]. As in subsection \ref{subsec:exp_a} the
choice of field densities and $k$ is $(d_{\bm{l}},d_{\alpha},k) = (40, 2^5,
10)$.

Figure \ref{fig:c:errors_and_time} illustrates that, with the exception of
NDT, all versions of CBGL exhibit mean positional errors less than $1.0$ m; its
combination with \texttt{x1} exhibits a mean error of approximately $0.5$ m.
The evidence support the claim that CBGL is robust to sensor angular range,
as the distributions of errors are indistinguishable between bottom-$k$
($\mathcal{H}_1$) sets for $k=10$.

Figure \ref{fig:c:time_analysis} shows the execution time of FastVGICP and
\texttt{x1} as a function of environmental area, and \texttt{x1}'s timing
breakdown with respect to (a) calculating up to line \ref{alg:cbgl:h1} of
Algorithm \ref{alg:cbgl} (that is CBGL's total time minus scan--to--map-scan
matching time) and (b) computing map-scans, as proportions of total execution
time. Given the evidence one may conclude that CBGL's execution time is linear
with respect to environment area for areas larger than 200 m$^2$, with slope
$l = 17$\texttt{e}-$03$.

           are virtually unaffected by the decrease in angular range $\lambda$
           ($\lambda_{\text{NDT}} = \lambda_{\text{FastGICP}} =
           \lambda_{\text{FastVGICP}} = 3\pi/2 \neq \lambda_{\texttt{x1}} = 2\pi$)
