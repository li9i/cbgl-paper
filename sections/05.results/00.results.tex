This section serves the testing of the performance of state of the global
localisation art methods and CBGL with regard to solving Problem
\ref{prob:the_problem} in static environments, varying environmental
conditions, sensor configurations, and map representations. With regard to CBGL,
its three required parameters are set to $(d_{\bm{l}},d_{\alpha},k) = (40, 2^5,
10)$ after initial experimental tests with the dataset used in subsection
\ref{subsec:exp_a}. The rationale of choosing appropriate
$d_{\bm{l}},d_{\alpha}$ is depicted in figure \ref{fig:a:determine_40_32};
$k$ is chosen as such in order to retain a high-enough true positive discovery
rate without significant increase in execution time. The locational threshold
$\delta_{\bm{l}} = 0.5$ m is used as a tighter solution admissibility criterion
determinator than that of \cite{Filotheou2022g}; the thresold itself was
determined through experimental procedure with a YDLIDAR TG30 sensor (footnote
3).
%(due to the application of scan--to--map-scan matching on $k$ pose estimates).

\subsection{Experiments in real conditions}
\label{subsec:exp_a}

The first type of test is conducted using a Hokuyo UTM-30LX sensor, whose
angular range is $\lambda = 3\pi/2$ rad and radial range $r_{\max} = 30.0$ m,
in the  Electrical and Computer Engineering Department's Laboratory of Computer
Systems Architecture (CSAL), of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, an
Occupancy Grid map of which is depicted in figure
\ref{fig:a:map_and_trajectory}. The sensor was mounted on a Robotnik RB1 robot,
which was teleoperated within the environment while scans were being recorded.
This resulted in $N_E = 6669$ range scans, whose number of rays are downsampled
by a factor of four before being inputted to CBGL and Advanced Localization
System (ALS) \cite{als_jp}. The latter implements Free-Space Features
\cite{als_eth} and, contrary to CBGL, is not a single-shot method;
however, it is selected for comparison against CBGL due to the fact that it is
the only state of the art global localisation method which exhibits feasible
execution times with respect to the collected range dataset's volume (see
bottom of fig.  \ref{fig:b:boxplots} for indicative execution times of state of
the art methods). CBGL's internal \texttt{sm2} method is chosen to be PLICP
\cite{Censi2008c} due to its low execution time and the sensor's non-panoramic
field of view. The top of figure \ref{fig:a:awesomeness} depicts the proportion
of output pose estimates from each method whose position and orientation error
is lower than outlier thresholds $\delta_{\bm{l}}$, $\delta_{\theta}$; at the
bottom they are depicted exclusively for CBGL's output and its internal pose
sets. Table \ref{tbl:a} provides a summary of the magnitude of pose errors and
execution times of the two methods.

\label{tbl:a}
\end{table}

From the experimental evidence it is clear that CBGL manages to produce
admissible solutions to Problem \ref{prob:the_problem} $991$ times out of a
thousand for an outliers' locational threshold $\delta_{\bm{l}} = 0.5$ m when
an angular threshold $\delta_{\theta}$ is not considered, and (b) CBGL

\subsection{Simulations against sources of uncertainty}
\label{subsec:exp_b}

The second type of test concerns the main limiting factor of global
localisation methods, i.e. uncertainty---: arising e.g. from spurious
measurements, repeatability of surroundings, missing or corrupted range
information, or their combinations. For this reason the experimental procedure
of \cite{Filotheou2022g} is extended here for the two methods tested therein,
i.e. Passive Global Localisation-Fourier-Mellin Invariant matching with
Centroids for translation (PGL-FMIC) and- Point-to-Line ICP (PGL-PLICP), and
then for ALS, Monte Carlo Localisation (MCL) \cite{mcl}, and
General Monte Carlo Localisation (GMCL) \cite{gmcl}. All methods are tested
against the two most challenging environments, i.e.  WAREHOUSE and
WILLOWGARAGE, in which a panoramic range sensor is placed at $16$ different
poses, respectively $\bm{p}_{\ast}^{W}$ and $\bm{p}_{\ast}^{G}$, for $N = 100$
independent attempts at global localisation per pose. The tests are conducted
with the use of a sensor whose number of rays $N_s = 360$, maximum range
$r_{\max} = 10.0$ m, and noise $\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.05^2)$ [m,m$^2$].  CBGL's
internal \texttt{sm2} method is chosen to be \texttt{x1} due to the periodicity
of the range signal, \texttt{x1}'s robust pose errors compared to \texttt{sm2}
state of the art methods, and its greater ability in matching scans captured
from higher initial displacements than ICP alternatives \cite{Filotheou2023a}.
The latter translates to the need for smaller initial hypothesis sets: for each
environment the locational density is set to $3$\texttt{e}+04 divided by the
free space area of each environment. For Monte Carlo approaches MCL and GMCL
the number of initial hypotheses is also set to $3$\texttt{e}+04.

The maximum range of the sensor is such that the geometry of environment
WAREHOUSE causes (disorderly) extended lack of sampling of the sensor's
surrounding environment, which limits available information and may therefore
produce spurious measurements and increase \texttt{r}-field ambiguities between
candidate estimates. In WILLOWGARAGE, on the other hand, almost all sensor
placements result in complete sampling of its surroundings, but the sensor is
purposefully posed in such conditions as to challenge the localisation methods'
ability to perform fine distinctions between similar surroundings. Figure
\ref{fig:b:inliers_per_pose} depicts the percentage of outputs whose position
error is lower than $\delta_{\bm{l}} = 0.5$ m per tested pose, and figure
\ref{fig:b:boxplots} depicts the overall distribution of position errors,
orientation errors, and execution times per tested environment and algorithm.
Although the cardinality of set $\mathcal{H}$ is equal in both environments,
CBGL's execution times are uneven due to \texttt{x1}'s increased execution time
when dealing with scans with missing range information. ALS is more robust
against missing information than against repeated surroundings, while PGL-PLICP
exhibits the inverse tendency. Notwithstanding the aforementioned sources of
uncertainty, CBGL manages to exhibit the overall highest number of poses whose
position error is below $\delta_{\bm{l}} = 0.5$ m.

\subsection{Simulations against environmental and \texttt{sm2} algorithmic disparity}
\label{subsec:exp_c}

The third type of test aims to inquire how the performance of CBGL scales with
respect to increasing environment area (and therefore to increased number of
hypotheses), environment diversity, sensor angular range, and choice of
overlying \texttt{sm2} method. CBGL is tested once in each of $N_E \simeq
4.5$\texttt{e}+$04$ environments, generated via the evaluation procedure of
\cite{Filotheou2023a}, which utilises five established and publicly available
benchmark datasets provided courtesy of the Department of Computer Science,
University of Freiburg \cite{datasets_link}. Each coordinate of the Point Cloud
map of each environment is corrupted by noise $\sim\mathcal{N}(0,0.05^2)$ [m,
m$^2$].  The angular range of the range sensor varies according to the
overlying \texttt{sm2} method used: for Normal Distribution Transform (NDT)
\cite{ndt}, Fast Generalised ICP (FastGICP) \cite{fgi}, and Fast Voxelised
Generalised ICP (FastVGICP) \cite{fvg}: $\lambda = 3\pi/2$ rad; for
\texttt{x1}: $\lambda = 2\pi$ rad. Measurement noise is $\sim
\mathcal{N}(0,0.03^2)$ [m,m$^2$]. As in subsection \ref{subsec:exp_a} the
choice of field densities and $k$ is $(d_{\bm{l}},d_{\alpha},k) = (40, 2^5,
10)$.

Figure \ref{fig:c:errors_and_time} illustrates that, with the exception of NDT,
all versions of CBGL exhibit mean positional errors less than $1.0$ m; its
combination with \texttt{x1} exhibits a mean error of approximately $0.5$ m.
The evidence illustrate that CBGL is robust to sensor angular range, as the
distributions of errors between bottom-$k$ ($\mathcal{H}_1$) sets are
virtually indistinguishable for $k=10$. Figure \ref{fig:c:time_analysis} shows
the execution time of CBGL combined with FastVGICP and \texttt{x1} as a
function of environmental area, and that with \texttt{x1}'s timing breakdown
with respect to (a) CBGL's total time minus \texttt{sm2} time and (b) computing
map-scans, as proportions of total execution time.

           are virtually unaffected by the decrease in angular range $\lambda$
