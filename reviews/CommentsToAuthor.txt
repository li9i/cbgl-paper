Comments to author (Associate Editor)
=====================================

# Contributions
- The paper introduces CBGL, an efficient 2D Lidar and
Monte-Carlo (MC) based global localization system that
extends the CAER (cumulative absolute error per ray) loss
and uses scan-to-map matching for pose refinement.

# Summary of strengths
-  Backed by extensive analysis, the approach demonstrates
improvements (runtime, pose discovery rate) over existing
global localization methods.
- The source code of the proposed CBGL method is made
publicly available which is useful for reproducibility
purposes.
- The limitation section is appreciated.

# Summary of weaknesses
- Claims: Please ensure that the claims are reasonable and
do not overpromise. For instance, reduce the claim of true
global localization to the assumed conditions under which
the claim is true (e.g., limited-size scene).
- Consider defining CBGL earlier in the paper (e.g.,
Abstract).
- Clarifications: There are some unclear points and the
reviewers suggest restructuring the experiment section.
Please see the reviewers' feedback for details and consider
incorporating the suggestions.
