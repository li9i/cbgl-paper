Comments to the author
======================

In this article, the author presents a method for global
localization using a 2D LIDAR sensor. The structure and
language of the article are good.
The presented CBGL method is based on the CAER (cummulative
absolute error per ray) metric, which is used in Monte
Carlo localization in combination with scan matching. The
presented results show an improvement over the existing
global localization methods, but there are also some
unclear points.

There are several points in the paper that should be
improved:
- In section V-A it is not clear how the environment map
was created and how accurate it is
- Section V-A states: "see bottom of &#64257;g. 8b for
indicative execution times of state of the art methods",
but Fig. 8b does not show any execution times
- in Sction V-B x1 is not defined
- Comparing section V-A and V-B, why wasn't the same sm2
method used in both sections? Does this mean that the use
of sm2 depends on the environment?
- Section V-C mentions 45402 environments. Even if this is
a public data set, a further sentence should be inserted
about the range of these environments.
- Why does the angular range of the range sensor in section
V-C vary depending on the sm2 method? Why is the same
angular range not used for all experiments? This should be
explained in more detail.
- In Section V-C, the sentence "Figure 9 illustrates that,
with the exception of NDT, all versions of CBGL exhibit
mean positional errors less than 1.0 m; its combination
with x1 exhibits a mean error of approximately 0.5 m." not
clear. Is x1 independent of the sm2 method or is it
combined with NDT. Which result is shown in Figure 9?
- Figure 11 should be further explained and made clearer.
